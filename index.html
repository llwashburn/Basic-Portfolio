				<p>
					Leslie Washburn graduated from the University of Georgia in 2002 with a B.A. in Communications. She has worked for Hugo Boss Inc.,  Savannah Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Savannah College of Art in Design. Her career 
					focus was event planning and project management.  After Leslie left SCAD in 2016, she taught herself Quickbooks and began taking on clients as a Bookkeeper. Even though this endeavour lasted for a short time, she finally recognized her underlying attraction to computers and web design.
					Project management, computers and design have always been an area of interest, so it just seemed natural that coding was the next step . </p>
				<p>
					Leslie resides in Savannah, Georgia with her husband Dallas, two boys, Owen (8),  Charlie (4) and Emma, the Basset Hound. 
					She is a foodie, runner, mother, wife, stylist, lover of art, wine and all things fun. Enthusiastic Web Developer in training.
